2. You can directly go to ```SignIn``` or ```SignUp``` page from here.
3. Handling 4 use-cases successfully:
   1. ```USE_CASE_1```: Try to ```SignUp``` with an existing email
      1. behavior: can not
   2. ```USE_CASE_2```: Try to ```SignIn``` with an existing email

### ```USE_CASE_1``` ###
1. Let's try to ```SignUp``` with an existing email (```jon@doe```) : </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_signup_fill_email_exists.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>
2. It doesn't let you SignUp with an already existing email in database: </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_signup_email_exists.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

### ```USE_CASE_2``` ###
1. So now, ```SignIn``` using this existing email: </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_signin_fill_existing_email.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
2. ```SignIn``` is successful: </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_signin_successful.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>

### ```USE_CASE_3``` ###
1. Now, let's ```SignUp``` with a new email: </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_signup_new_email.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>
2. ```SignUp``` is successful: </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_signup_successful.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>

### ```USE_CASE_4``` ###
1. Lastly,  let's try to ```SignIn``` using a new email: </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_signin_with_new_email.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>
2. It does not let it: </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_signin_with_new_email_fails.png" alt="drawing" width="350"/>


## Tech-Features ##

1. Added Junit Tests
2. Added Jacoco for measuring test coverage, with achieving 
   1. 100% lines/instructions coverage 
   2. 100% branch coverage
   3. for all Controllers: </br><img src="documentation/v2/v2_jacoco_test_coverage.png" alt="drawing" width="450"/>
3. Added ```NoNull``` constraint on ```email``` column of DAO ```UserEntity```.
4. Added ```UniqueKey``` constraint on ```email``` column of DAO ```UserEntity```.
5. Added check that email can't be set empty while ```SingnUp```.
6. Handling 4 use-cases successfully:
   1. ```USE_CASE_1```: Try to ```SignUp``` with an existing email
      1. behavior: can not
   2. ```USE_CASE_2```: Try to ```SignIn``` with an existing email
      1. behavior: Successful
   3. ```USE_CASE_3```: Try to ```SignUp``` with a new email

7. Not checking password match for ```SignIn```
8. Not checking password sanity for ```SignUp```


## Potential for v3 ##

1. Increase Fields for User Input
2. Add ability for users to update once they ```SignIn```
3. Add caching to DB layer
4. Add session management
5. Increase password sanitation and validation check
6. Store password securely and sensitively.
   1. Maybe just store hash (with salting) and not actual passwords in DB
7. Add more test cases.
