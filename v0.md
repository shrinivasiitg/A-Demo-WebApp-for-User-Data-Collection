## A demo Web Application to take user input from the end-users

## How To Run ?

### This is inspired from [Spring-IO source](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/#scratch) and [Spring-IO rest-service](https://start.spring.io/)

Since we are using Maven, we can run the application by

(1) building the JAR file with

```shell
./mvnw clean package
````

(2) and then run the JAR file as:

```shell
java -jar target/UserDataCollection-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

(3) Now, enjoy

```sh
open:- http://localhost:8080/
```
