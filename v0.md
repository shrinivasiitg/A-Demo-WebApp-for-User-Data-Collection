# A-Demo-WebApp-for-User-Data-Collection

## A demo Web Application to take user input from the end-users. Play with it, here in AWS (while it is live, for limited time) : http://44.201.181.113:8080

## How To Run ?

### This is inspired from [Spring-IO source](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/#scratch) and [Spring-IO rest-service](https://start.spring.io/)

Since we are using Maven, we can run the application by

(1) building the JAR file with

```shell
./mvnw clean package
````

(2) and then run the JAR file as:

```shell
java -jar target/UserDataCollection-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

(3) Now, enjoy

```sh
open:- http://localhost:8080/
```

## Setup JAVA (for the first time, typically on your cloud server such as AWS EC2 host)

If ```JAVA_HOME``` is not setup already, you might see errors like
```shell
Error: JAVA_HOME is not defined correctly.
  We cannot execute 
```

Install ```Java-11``` for this project. I am explaining here for ubuntu OS, follow similar process for your OS:
```shell
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless -y
```

This was sufficient for me (with Ubuntu OS). Kindly find/follow the standard ```JAVA``` setup process for your OS.
